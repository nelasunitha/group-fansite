        Vegetarian Biryani:
        <span class="black-text">A vibrant and flavorful dish of fragrant basmati rice cooked with a medley of fresh, colorful vegetables such as carrots, beans, peas, and bell peppers. It’s infused with a symphony of aromatic spices like cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and bay leaves, creating a mouthwatering aroma. The biryani is elevated with layers of caramelized onions, golden roasted cashews, and raisins for a hint of sweetness. A touch of saffron and ghee adds richness, while fresh coriander and mint leaves provide a refreshing finish.

        Non-Vegetarian Biryani:
        <span class="black-text">A rich and hearty dish featuring fragrant basmati rice layered with tender, succulent pieces of marinated chicken, mutton, or shrimp, cooked to perfection. The meat is slow-cooked with a blend of bold spices like cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and star anise, along with saffron-infused rice for a royal touch. Each layer is enriched with ghee, fried onions, and fresh herbs, creating a symphony of flavors. Garnished with crispy onions, boiled eggs, and a squeeze of lemon, this biryani is traditionally served with cooling raita (yogurt raita) or spicy salan, making it a complete and indulgent meal.</span>
